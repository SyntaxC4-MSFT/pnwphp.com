                    PNWPHP will be hosted at Impact Hub Seattle, a cool co-working and event venue in the Pioneer Square
                    neighborhood of downtown Seattle, within walking distance of Pike Place Market, the Puget Sound
                    waterfront, the Seattle Underground Tour, Century Link Field, many hotels and restaurants, King
                    Street Station, and the SoundTransit Central Link light railâ€”for easy access to SeaTac (SEA)
                    airport. It is also only about 2 miles away from the Space Needle and Pacific Science Center. We
                    hope that you'll spend some time before or after the conference exploring our city.
